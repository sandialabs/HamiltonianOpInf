This repo contains branches with files needed to reproduce results in the following papers: 

A. Gruber, I. Tezaur.  "Canonical and Noncanonical Hamiltonian Operator Inference", CMAME 2023.

A. Gruber, I. Tezaur.  "Variationally Consistent Hamiltonian Model Reduction", SIADS 2024.

Branch "master" corresponds to the CMAME paper and branch "var-consistent" corresponds to the SIADS paper.  Codes in these branches are not cross-compatible (sorry).

The various .ipynb/.py files can be run straight down to reproduce the results in the papers.  The *_utils.py files contain the source code for the method.
